# Programming-for-Analytics-Research-Project
## CIS 3120 Project

Project Summary:

• Constructed a Facebook dataset to study user information based on age, gender, tenure, and likes.

• Adopted data cleaning and preprocessing methods in the Python programming language to guarantee the accuracy and reliability of Facebook user data, highlighting diligence, and data integrity.

• Modeled with 5 team members to understand the findings and draw conclusions from the study of Facebook data.


Objective: To apply programming skills and data analytics techniques to solve a real-world problem using Python, NumPy, and Pandas


Project Overview:

Teams will be tasked with selecting a dataset of their choice, performing data cleaning and preprocessing, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applying various statistical techniques and/or machine learning algorithms to answer specific research questions. Teams will then present their findings using a short PowerPoint presentation.


Instructions:

1. Select a dataset:

• Choose a dataset relevant to your interests or an industry you would like to explore.

• The dataset should be large enough to apply data analytics techniques and have multiple variables/features.

• Recommended sources: Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, World Bank, or any open data portal.



2. Define the research question(s):

• Clearly state the problem or research question(s) that you intend to address using data analytics.

• The question(s) should be specific and well-defined and should require the application of data analytics techniques to be answered.



3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

• Import the dataset using Python and relevant libraries (NumPy, Pandas).

• Perform necessary data cleaning, such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data entry errors.

• Perform data preprocessing, including data type conversions, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.



4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

• Conduct an EDA to understand the structure, distribution, and relationships among variables in the dataset.


• Use visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, box plots, heatmaps) to explore the data and identify trends or patterns.



5. Data Analytics Techniques:

• Apply relevant statistical techniques and/or machine learning algorithms to answer the research question(s).

• Validate your results and discuss any limitations or assumptions made during the analysis.



6. PowerPoint Presentation:

• Prepare a 3-4 slide presentation summarizing your project.
